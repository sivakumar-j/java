 Below are examples of Composition in Java ( In Inheritance we can use only one class, so it is always best to use composition ) 
 
 Challenge 1 : Create a PC from Case,Monitor and Motherboard
 
 Challenge 2 : 
 
  Create a single room of a house using composition.
  Think about the things that should be included in the room.
  Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well
  Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and
  then that objects public method as you saw in the previous video
  then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter
  but to access the object used in composition within the main class
  like you saw in this video.
